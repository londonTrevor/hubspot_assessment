  - name: int_availabilities_spans
    description: "An intermediate table built in order to segregate some more complex logic needed
                  to derive vacancy spans. These vacancy spans are chunks of time in which a rental
                  has no reservations and is available. The logic is built in such a way to reset the
                  running count at each new span, which is any time in which the day is not consecutive."
